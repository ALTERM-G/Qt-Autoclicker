 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
 Preamble  
  
 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  
  
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share the software and change it.  
 By doing this you help to ensure that the software is used properly.  
  
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it.  
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether modified or unmodified, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients that you received.  
 You must make sure that everyone else also receives or can get the source code.  
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  
  
 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:  
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and  
 (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify it.  
  
 Therefore, you need to make sure that everyone else also receives or can get the source code.  
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  
  
 This version of the GNU GPL is the first to give the world a way to verbatim copy. For a complete copy, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.  
  
 Finally, any party that redistributes the software must provide the source alongside it, or show how it can be obtained.
